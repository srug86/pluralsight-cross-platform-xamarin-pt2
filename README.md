# pluralsight-cross-platform-xamarin-pt2
Learn how to use Xamarin to leverage your skills in Microsoft Visual Studio and C# to build cross-platform apps that run on both Android and iOS. In the second part of this course series, we focus on using Xamarin to build a rich user experience that embraces the capabilities and feel of each platform. In this course we expand the application from part 1 to incorporate rich gesture-based paging, allowing the user to perform swipe actions to move between data items. We introduce a master detail relationship to manage groups of data items utilizing the appropriate metaphor for each platform. We also incorporate platform-specific features such as page-turning animations on iOS and slide-out navigation drawers on Android.
